NetworkManager-l2tp-1.7.0  (development) 
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-l2tp-1.2.12
==========================================================

DO NOT PROVIDE PRE-BUILT BINARIES of THIS RELEASE UNTIL THE INTENDED LINUX
DISTRIBUTION SHIPS WITH OPENSSL 3.0.0 OR LATER THAT IS COMPATIBLE with the
GPLv2 LICENSE.

This is a development release of NetworkManager-l2tp for those that wish to
try user or machine TLS certificate support with L2TP/IPsec VPN servers.
For TLS certificate support, the code needs to be linked against libcrypto
from OpenSSL version 1.1.0 or later.
Note: OpenSSL versions prior to 3.0.0 are not under the GPL compatible Apache
License v2 :
    https://www.openssl.org/source/license.html

* Update translations by merging from various sources.
* User and machine TLS certificate support.
* Uses NMACertChooser widget introduced with NetworkManager 1.8.0
  for certificate support in the GUI.
* Routines to auto detect the following TLS certificate and private key file
  formats by looking at the file contents and not the file extension, also
  determines if the files are encrypted with a password, which includes
  testing if the password is the empty string on NULL :
  - PKCS#12 certificates.
  - X509 certificates (PEM or DER).
  - PKCS#8 private keys (PEM or DER)
  - traditional OpenSSL RSA, DSA and ECDSA private keys (PEM or DER).
* Routines to import certificates and privates keys into a Libreswan NSS
  database.

NetworkManager-l2tp-1.2.12
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-l2tp-1.2.10
==========================================================

* Update translations by merging from various sources.
* Added Legacy Proposal button.
  Clicking Legacy Proposals button populates Phase 1 and 2 Algorithm text entry
  boxes with proposals offered by Windows Server 2019:
  - AES256, SHA-1, ECP384 and AES128, SHA-1, ECP256 strong proposals.
    strongSwan recommends not using SHA-1 in its security recommendations
    documentation.
  - 3DES, SHA-1, MODP1024 broken proposal.
    Legacy Windows 2000 Server era proposal still commonly offered, especially
    with consumer routers
* Added following IPsec configuration options:
  - Phase1 Lifetime - ikelifetime.
  - Phase2 Lifetime - salifetime (libreswan) / lifetime (strongswan).
  - Use IP compression - compress.
  - Disable PFS - pfs.
* renamed Gateway ID to Remote ID and updated GUI tooltip.
* removed restrictions that only IP addresses are allowed for the Remote ID.
* Generated config file changes, following config files :
  - /var/run/nm-l2tp-xl2tpd-_UUID_.conf
  - /var/run/nm-l2tp-xl2tpd-control-_UUID_
  - /var/run/nm-l2tp-xl2tpd-_UUID_.pid
  - /var/run/nm-l2tp-ppp-options-_UUID_
  are now:
  - /var/run/nm-l2tp-_UUID_/xl2tpd.conf
  - /var/run/nm-l2tp-_UUID_/xl2tpd-control
  - /var/run/nm-l2tp-_UUID_/xl2tpd-.pid
  - /var/run/nm-l2tp-_UUID_/ppp-options
* Use same IP secrets file for all L2TP connections, 
  /etc/ipsec.d/ipsec.nm-l2tp.secrets is now used instead of
  /etc/ipsec.d/nm-l2tp-ipsec-_UUID_.secrets, where _UUID_ was the UUID of the
  VPN connection.
* Force ikev2=never for Libreswan 
  ikev2=permit is the implicit default setting, which tries to detect
  a "bid down" attack from IKEv2 to IKEv1 and can have an impact on
  the default proposals.
* Add nm-l2tp-service- prefix back to pppd ipparam argument.
  The ipparam argument is used by a condition in the Debian resolvconf's
  /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/000resolvconf script.
* PSK is now Base64 encoded, allows PSK to contain double quotation mark (").
* Fix build without GTK/Gnome.
* Legacy KDE Plasman-nm user certificate support.
* libnm-glib compatibility (NetworkManager < 1.0) is disabled by default.
  It can be enabled by passing --with-libnm-glib to configure script.
  Nobody should need it by now. Users that still use this are encouraged
  to let us know before the libnm-glib support is removed for good.
* The auth helper in external UI mode can now be run without a display
  server. Future nmcli version will utilize this for handling the
secrets without a graphical desktop.

NetworkManager-l2tp-1.2.10
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-l2tp-1.2.8
=======================================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager-l2tp.  Notable changes include:

* Point version 1.2.10 appdata image URIs to nm-1-2 github branch:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nm-l2tp/NetworkManager-l2tp/nm-1-2/appdata
* Corrected force UDP encapsulation toggle button behavior.
* Workaround for libreswan `ipsec status` issue with short (< 8 char) PSKs.
* fix gcc -Wimplicit-fallthrough warning.

=======================================================
NetworkManager-l2tp-1.2.8
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-l2tp-1.2.6
=======================================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager-l2tp.  Notable changes include:

* Updated translations, merged from NetworkManager-applet,
  NetworkManager-libreswan, NetworkManager-pptp and
  KDE Plasma NetworkManagement L2TP. Removed obsolete translations.
* Enforce UDP encapsulation toggle button fix.
* Stop strongSwan service when a connection cannot be established.
* fix entries in Debian Lintian spelling-error-in-binary report.
* configure --runstatedir support if using Autoconf >= 2.7.0.
* If "Automatic (VPN) Addresses Only" mode is enabled in the the IPv4
  config settings, do not use the pppd usepeerdns option.
  i.e. do not overide /etc/resolv.conf.

=======================================================
NetworkManager-l2tp-1.2.6
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-l2tp-1.2.4
=======================================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager-l2tp.  Notable changes include:

* If L2TP port 1701 is already in use, no longer writes
  "leftprotoport=udp/l2tp" (which is equivalent to "leftprotoport=udp/1701") to
  the ipsec config file. This was done to ensures L2TP is encapsulated in IPsec
* Uses UUID instead of PID for run-time generated filenames
* No longer temporarily replaces system /etc/ipsec.secrets file
* IPsec rekeying is now possible because the following file remains for the
  lifetime of the VPN connection :
    /etc/ipsec.d/nm-l2tp-ipsec-UUID.secrets
* Following line is appended to /etc/ipsec.secrets if the include line is
  missing:
    include /etc/ipsec.d/*.secrets
* Removed IPsec Group Name from user interface
* Added IPsec Phase 1 (ike) & Phase 2 (esp) to user interface
* New timeout code for IPsec connection up script.

=======================================================
NetworkManager-l2tp-1.2.4
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-l2tp-1.2.2
=======================================================

This is a new stable release of NetworkManager-l2tp.  Notable changes include:

* Prefer building against stable libsecret API
* Split libnm-vpn-plugin-l2tp.so into a GTK-free core plugin
  usable by nmcli and a UI plugin for nm-applet and gnome components
* Successfully builds on 32bit Linux 
* Explicitly check strongSwan connection has been established
  and not trust use exit status of strongSwan 'ipsec up' command
* Support weaker initial proposals on later versions of strongSwan
* Support IP addresses for IPsec leftid and rightid
* 10 second timeout for ipsec starter process
