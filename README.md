If you wish to distribute NetworkManager-l2tp 1.8.2 binaries for a Linux
distribution, please note that there is a GPL/OpenSSL license conflict
with OpenSSL < 3.0.0 on Linux distibutions that do not consider OpenSSL
(or LibreSSL) to be a "System Library". See release notes for further details:

----

NetworkManager-l2tp is a VPN plugin for NetworkManager 1.8 and later which
provides support for L2TP and L2TP/IPsec (i.e. L2TP over IPsec) connections.

For L2TP support, it uses xl2tpd ( https://www.xelerance.com/software/xl2tpd/ )

For IPsec support, it uses either of the following :
* Libreswan ( https://libreswan.org )
* strongSwan ( https://www.strongswan.org )

For user authentication it supports either:
* username/pasword credentials.
* TLS certificates.

For machine authentication is supports either:
* Pre-shared key (PSK).
* TLS certificates.

This VPN plugin auto detect the following TLS certificate and private key file
formats by looking at the file contents and not the file extension :
* PKCS#12 certificates.
* X509 certificates (PEM or DER).
* PKCS#8 private keys (PEM or DER)
* traditional OpenSSL RSA, DSA and ECDSA private keys (PEM or DER).

For TLS user certificate support, the ppp package has to have the EAP-TLS patch
for pppd applied to the ppp source code (which many Linux distributions already
do) :

* https://www.nikhef.nl/~janjust/ppp/

## Building

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure  # (see below)
    make

The default ./configure settings aren't reasonable and should be explicitly
overridden with ./configure arguments. In the configure examples below, you
may need to change the `--with-pppd-plugin-dir` value to an appropriate
directory that exists.

#### Debian >= 10 and Ubuntu >= 18.04 (AMD64, i.e. x86-64)

    ./configure \
      --disable-static --prefix=/usr \
      --sysconfdir=/etc --libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu \
      --libexecdir=/usr/lib/NetworkManager \
      --localstatedir=/var \
      --with-pppd-plugin-dir=/usr/lib/pppd/2.4.7

#### Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (x86-64)

    ./configure \
      --disable-static --prefix=/usr \
      --sysconfdir=/etc --libdir=/usr/lib64 \
      --localstatedir=/var \
      --with-pppd-plugin-dir=/usr/lib64/pppd/2.4.7

#### openSUSE (x86-64)

    ./configure \
      --disable-static --prefix=/usr \
      --sysconfdir=/etc --libdir=/usr/lib64 \
      --libexecdir=/usr/lib \
      --localstatedir=/var \
      --with-pppd-plugin-dir=/usr/lib64/pppd/2.4.7

## VPN connection profile files

VPN connection profile files (along with other NetworkManager profile files)
are stored under `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/`

## Run-time generated files

The following files located under `/var/run` assume `--localstatedir=/var` or
`--runstatedir=/var/run` were supplied to the configure script at build time.

* /var/run/nm-l2tp-_UUID_/xl2tpd.conf
* /var/run/nm-l2tp-_UUID_/xl2tpd-control
* /var/run/nm-l2tp-_UUID_/xl2tpd.pid
* /var/run/nm-l2tp-_UUID_/ppp-options
* /var/run/nm-l2tp-_UUID_/ipsec.conf
* /etc/ipsec.d/ipsec.nm-l2tp.secrets

where _UUID_ is the NetworkManager UUID for the VPN connection.

If strongswan is being used, NetworkManager-l2tp will append the following line
to `/etc/ipsec.secrets` at run-time if the line is missing:

    include ipsec.d/ipsec.nm-l2tp.secrets

## Password protecting the libreswan NSS database

By default the libreswan NSS database is created in `/etc/ipsec.d/` and is used
by NetworkManager-l2tp for VPN connections using libreswan and machine
certificates.

The default libreswan package install for most Linux distributions uses an
empty password. It is up to the administrator to decide on whether to use a
password or not. However, a non-empty database password must be provided when
running in FIPS mode.

See the following page on how to set the password for the libreswan NSS database
and the syntax for the `/etc/ipsec.d/nsspassword` file where the password is
stored:
* https://libreswan.org/wiki/HOWTO:_Using_NSS_with_libreswan

## Debugging

For Systemd based Linux distributions logging goes to the Systemd journal
which can be viewed by issuing the following :

    journalctl --unit=NetworkManager

For non-Systemd based Linux distributions, view the appropriate system log
file which is most likely located under `/var/log/`.

### Increase Debugging Output

To increase debugging output, issue the following on the command line, it
will also prevent the run-time generated config files from being deleted after
the VPN connection is disconnected :

#### Debian and Ubuntu
    sudo killall -TERM nm-l2tp-service
    sudo /usr/lib/NetworkManager/nm-l2tp-service --debug

#### Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    sudo killall -TERM nm-l2tp-service
    sudo /usr/libexec/nm-l2tp-service --debug

#### openSUSE
    sudo killall -TERM nm-l2tp-service
    sudo /usr/lib/nm-l2tp-service --debug

then start your VPN connection and reproduce the problem.

For Systemd based Linux distributions when increasing the debugging output
by running `nm-l2tp-service --debug` on the command-line, do not use
`journalctl --unit=NetworkManager` as you may not see all the logs, instead
issue:

    journalctl -b

### Libreswan Custom Debugging

The Libreswan debugging can be cutomized by setting the `PLUTODEBUG` env
variable which corresponds to the `plutodebug` ipsec.conf config section option.
The syntax for `PLUTODEBUG` is a white-space separated list of the following
format :

    PLUTODEBUG="TYPE TYPE ... TYPE"

Where TYPE is a debug option from the list output by issuing the following on
the command-line :

    ipsec whack --debug list

*Examples:*

#### Debian and Ubuntu
    sudo PLUTODEBUG="all proposal-parser" /usr/lib/NetworkManager/nm-l2tp-service --debug

#### Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    sudo PLUTODEBUG="all proposal-parser" /usr/libexec/nm-l2tp-service --debug

### strongSwan Custom Debugging

The strongSwan debugging can be cutomized by setting the `CHARONDEBUG` env
variable which corresponds to the `charondebug` ipsec.conf config section option.
The syntax for `CHARONDEBUG` is a comma separated list of the following format :

    CHARONDEBUG="TYPE LEVEL, TYPE LEVEL, ..., TYPE LEVEL"

where TYPE is:
    any|dmn|mgr|ike|chd|job|cfg|knl|net|asn|enc|tnc|imc|imv|pts|tls|esp|lib

and LEVEL is: -1|0|1|2|3|4

*Examples:*

#### Debian and Ubuntu
    sudo CHARONDEBUG="knl 1, ike 2, esp 2, lib 1, cfg 3" /usr/lib/NetworkManager/nm-l2tp-service --debug

#### Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    sudo CHARONDEBUG="knl 1, ike 2, esp 2, lib 1, cfg 3" /usr/libexec/nm-l2tp-service --debug

#### openSUSE
    sudo CHARONDEBUG="knl 1, ike 2, esp 2, lib 1, cfg 3" /usr/lib/nm-l2tp-service --debug

## Issue with blacklisting of L2TP kernel modules

For compatibility with Microsoft L2TP servers (and with later kernel updates,
other L2TP servers), L2TP kernel modules are required.

If you see the following error message, then chances are that the `l2tp_ppp`
and `l2tp_netlink` kernel modules are blacklisted :
```
xl2tpd[1234]: L2TP kernel support not detected (try modprobing l2tp_ppp and pppol2tp)
```

`modprobe l2tp_ppp` (or `modprobe pppol2tp` for older kernels) can be used as a
temporary workaround instead of the permanent blacklist removal as described below.

The following is an extract from _"Enhanced security of auto-loading kernel
modules in RHEL 8 "_ web page :
* https://access.redhat.com/articles/3760101

> To enhance Red Hat Enterprise Linux against possible future security
> vulnerabilities in lesser-known components which system administrators
> typically do not protect against, a set of kernel modules have been moved to
> the `kernel-modules-extra` package and blacklisted by default so those
> components cannot be loaded by non-root users.
>
> When a system requires use of one of these kernel modules, the system
> administrator must explicitly remove the module blacklist.

Although the above is for RHEL8, it is also applicable to Fedora >= 31,
CentOS 8 and other derivatives.

The `/etc/modprobe.d/l2tp_netlink-blacklist.conf` file contains:
```sh
# Remove the blacklist by adding a comment # at the start of the line.
blacklist l2tp_netlink
```

The `/etc/modprobe.d/l2tp_ppp-blacklist.conf` file contains :
```sh
# Remove the blacklist by adding a comment # at the start of the line.
blacklist l2tp_ppp
```

To remove the blacklist of the L2TP modules by adding a # comment to the start
of the blacklist lines can be achieved with:
```
sudo sed -e '/blacklist l2tp_netlink/s/^b/#b/g' -i /etc/modprobe.d/l2tp_netlink-blacklist.conf
sudo sed -e '/blacklist l2tp_ppp/s/^b/#b/g' -i /etc/modprobe.d/l2tp_ppp-blacklist.conf
```

## Issue with not stopping system xl2tpd service

NetworkManager-l2tp starts its own instance of xl2tpd and if the system xl2tpd
service is running, its own xl2tpd instance will not be able to use UDP port
1701, so will use an ephemeral port (i.e. random high port).

Although the use of an ephemeral port is considered acceptable in RFC3193, the
L2TP/IPsec standard co-authored by Microsoft and Cisco, there are some
L2TP/IPsec servers and/or firewalls that will have issues if an ephemeral port
is used.

Stopping the system xl2tpd service should free UDP port 1701 and on systemd
based Linux distributions, the xl2tpd service can be stopped with the
following:

    sudo systemctl stop xl2tpd

If stopping the xl2tpd service fixes your VPN connection issue, you can
disable the xl2tpd service from starting at boot time with :

    sudo systemctl disable xl2tpd

## IPsec IKEv1 weak legacy algorithms and backwards compatibility

There is a general consensus that the following legacy algorithms are now
considered weak or broken in regards to security and should be phased out and
replaced with stronger algorithms.

Encryption Algorithms :
* 3DES
* Blowfish

Integrity Algorithms :
* MD5
* SHA1

Diffie Hellman Groups :
* MODP768
* MODP1024
* MODP1536

The following strongSwan page has more details on which algorithms are
considered broken:
* https://wiki.strongswan.org/projects/strongswan/wiki/IKEv1CipherSuites

Legacy algorithms that are considered weak or broken are regularly removed from
the default set of allowed algorithms with newer releases of strongSwan and
libreswan.

As of NetworkManager-l2tp version 1.2.16, it was decided to compromise for
backwards compatibility by not using the strongSwan and libreswan default set
of allowed algorithms, instead algorithms that are a merge of Windows 10 and
macOS/iOS/iPadOS L2TP/IPsec clients' IKEv1 proposals are used instead. The
weakest proposals that were not common to both Win10 and iOS were dropped, but
all of the strongest ones were kept:

| Phase 1 - Main Mode |
| ------------------- |
| {enc=AES_CBC_256 integ=HMAC_SHA2_256_128 group=MODP_2048} |
| {enc=AES_CBC_256 integ=HMAC_SHA2_256_128 group=MODP_1536} |
| {enc=AES_CBC_256 integ=HMAC_SHA2_256_128 group=MODP_1024} &ast; |
| {enc=AES_CBC_256 integ=HMAC_SHA1_96 group=MODP_2048} |
| {enc=AES_CBC_256 integ=HMAC_SHA1_96 group=MODP_1536} |
| {enc=AES_CBC_256 integ=HMAC_SHA1_96 group=MODP_1024} &ast; |
| {enc=AES_CBC_256 integ=HMAC_SHA1_96 group=ECP_384} |
| {enc=AES_CBC_128 integ=HMAC_SHA1_96 group=MODP_1024} &ast; |
| {enc=AES_CBC_128 integ=HMAC_SHA1_96 group=ECP_256} |
| {enc=3DES_CBC integ=HMAC_SHA1_96 group=MODP_2048} |
| {enc=3DES_CBC integ=HMAC_SHA1_96 group=MODP_1024} &ast; |

| Phase 2 - Quick Mode |
| ------------------- |
| {enc=AES_CBC_256 integ=HMAC_SHA1_96} |
| {enc=AES_CBC_128 integ=HMAC_SHA1_96} |
| {enc=3DES_CBC integ=HMAC_SHA1_96} |

&ast; Libreswan >= 3.30 is no longer built with DH2 (modp1024) support, so
above proposals with modp1024 have been excluded when libreswan is used,
except if NetworkManager-l2tp is built with the `--enable-libreswan-dh2`
configure switch.

The above proposals are equivalent to setting the following phase 1 and 2
algorithms in the **Advanced** section of NetworkManager-l2tp's IPsec Options
dialog box:

**Phase 1 algorithms** with libreswan :

    aes256-sha2_256-modp2048,aes256-sha2_256-modp1536,aes256-sha2_256-modp1024,aes256-sha1-modp2048,aes256-sha1-modp1536,aes256-sha1-modp1024,aes256-sha1-ecp_384,aes128-sha1-modp1024,aes128-sha1-ecp_256,3des-sha1-modp2048,3des-sha1-modp1024

**Phase 2 algorithms** with libreswan :

    aes256-sha1,aes128-sha1,3des-sha1

**Phase 1 algorithms** with strongSwan :

    aes256-sha2_256-modp2048,aes256-sha2_256-modp1536,aes256-sha2_256-modp1024,aes256-sha1-modp2048,aes256-sha1-modp1536,aes256-sha1-modp1024,aes256-sha1-ecp384,aes128-sha1-modp1024,aes128-sha1-ecp256,3des-sha1-modp2048,3des-sha1-modp1024!

**Phase 2 algorithms** with strongSwan :

    aes256-sha1,aes128-sha1,3des-sha1!

If you are not sure if you are using libreswan or strongSwan, issue the
following on the command-line:

```
ipsec --version
```

If you are concerned about security and wish to use algorithms that are
stronger than the proposals offered by Windows 10 and macOS/iOS/iPadOS
L2TP/IPsec clients, user specified phase 1 (*ike* - Main Mode) and phase 2
(*esp* - Quick Mode) algorithms can be specified in the IPsec Options dialog
box. Please see the libreswan or strongSwan `ipsec.conf` documentation for the
*ike* and *esp* (aka *phase2alg*) syntax.

If you are not sure which IKEv1 Phase 1 algorithms your VPN server proposes,
you can query the VPN server with the `ike-scan.sh` script located in the
IPsec IKEv1 algorithms section of the Wiki :
